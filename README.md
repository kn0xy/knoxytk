My Portfolio Website 2023


I designed and created this site to serve as my portfolio/showcase to potential employers during my job search in spring 2023.

It is split into 2 sections: The 2D site and the 3D site.

The 2D site consists of basic HTML, CSS, and JS, and is used as the content for the 2 computer monitors in the 3D site. Although most of the magic happens when rendered within the 3D site, each monitor can be viewed independently in a browser.

The 3D site consists of several interactable objects placed within a 3D viewport and features a virtual rendering of the 2D site placed on two computer monitors.

More info about the building process of the 3D site will be added soon.
